Various tools I use when creating my Motorcycle page for the trips I take

Obviously to send me e-mail just put the preceding two together --> Username@E-Mail (this is to minimize the amount of SPAM I get thank you)

Convert_gpx_to_Google_Plot_V2.0.ps1 - This GPX was tested with Motorcycle tracks but should work for ANY kind of GPX file. It will also work if you take your GPX device to take a hike and input the GPX file. In V2.0 fixed issues with Garmin adding in extensions, not the script only grabs Lat/Lon, Elevation, time to create the plot

Convert_gpx_to_2000_points_V1.0.ps1 - When you want to make a plot of your entire trip and there are more than 2000 points, Google will only plot 2000. This script takes every out every Nth point so that the sum total points is less than 2000
